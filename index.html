    <h2>Because existing is exhausting.</h2>
    <p>Students across the globe have been struggling with mental health issues, more now than ever before. With a pandemic locking us in our homes, to school pressure rising, the time we need for ourselves end up going towards something else.</p>
    <p>It’s about time we realize that we need as much attention as the “important” things, because we ARE important.</p>

      <li><b>It’s okay to feel.</b>

      So many people restrict their emotions, and keep them bottled up inside. This could be because you’re trying to be the “tough” one. Or maybe because you’re refusing to believe you feel that way. However, it’s okay to feel. Letting it out is super therapeutic and can help you move forward.</li>

      <li><b>Your body is a temple.</b>

      When worrying about everything else but yourself, you tend to forget that you need to be cared for. Remember that your body is the only one you have. Take an hour or two to yourself to get yourself and your body right back where it needs to be. </li>

      <li><b>Lock the phone, Close your eyes.</b>

      A lot of our problems can actually be caused by doing what we love to do most: scrolling through TikTok until 3 AM. It’s about time we realize how unhealthy that is for our mind, our eyes and our sleep schedules. Pace yourself, and remember, there’s always tomorrow!</li>

      <li><b>It’s okay to say no.</b>

      Are your friends going out tonight and really want you to come? But you’re not feeling up to interacting with others? Don’t even feel bad, and just say, “Maybe next time.” It’s okay to choose yourself. You’re not selfish and you’re not rude. You’re caring for yourself and for your own needs. </li>
